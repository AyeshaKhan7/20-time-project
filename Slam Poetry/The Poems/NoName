Who are you to run 
And make fun of others 
Who are you to disrespect your fathers and mothers
Always trying to perfect your singing in the showers
Wishing you had superpowers 
Who are you to call others cowards 
As you cower behind as nothing more than followers
As we try and blossom as flowers, in these monsoon showers
In lower levels, spread across longer hours. 
Chipping away at our work with power tools
As you laze around like fools
We spend days making the a/cs that make you cool
So let’s be honest we rule 
We aren’t the fondest of people 
Atleast not fond of you. 
You who run from the truth 
You who live waiting for a queue 

Then there's us who live working till curfew
working till are muscles droop
till even goop tastes good as food
living life out of the loop

as you live in it
convoluting it
